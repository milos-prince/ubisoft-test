Hi George, Ohsoke, and Stephanie :)

All of the relevent code can be found in the /src/components and /src/pages directories. I tried to make as many reusable components as I could in this challenge. A published version of the site can be found at https://inspiring-jones-e5b5e7.netlify.com/ . You can e-mail me at michael@freedomgopher.com if you have any questions about why I did anything in any particular way.

Sadly between getting home from work last night and going again this morning I wasn't able to complete the extra credit portion of the assignment on time, but if I had just a little more time I could implement it for you. Thanks again for this opportunity!

Have a nice day!
Mike
